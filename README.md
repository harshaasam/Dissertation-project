**The motivation for this project is the researcherâ€™s interest in cricket. Water scarcity has created problems for cricket on multiple occasions. Highly advanced stadiums use the SubAir system, which offers an aeration function to provide an ideal growth condition for the root zone and reduce turf diseases. Local stadiums and playgrounds cannot afford this system. Most of the local grounds do not have money to afford moisture level monitor equipment. This project is inspired by smart irrigation projects designed for the agriculture sector to predict soil moisture using environmental parameters and use water efficiently. This research implementation predicts soil moisture levels without any installations on the ground on a low budget and helps ground staff maintain ideal grass growth conditions.**
