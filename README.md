Motivation for this project is the researcherâ€™s interest in cricket. Water scarcity has created problem for cricket in multiple occasions [5]. Highly advanced stadiums use the SubAir system, which offers an aeration function to provide an ideal growth condition for the root zone and reduce turf diseases [6]. Local stadiums and playgrounds cannot afford this system. Most of the local grounds do not have money to afford moisture level monitor equipment. This project inspires from the smart irrigation projects designed for agriculture sector to predict the soil moisture using environmental parameters and use water efficiently. This research implementation predicts soil moisture levels without any installations on the ground in a low budget and helps ground staff to maintain ideal conditions for grass growth.
